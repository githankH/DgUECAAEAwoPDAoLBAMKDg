Acturally, I spent two night to do this project.

The progress time descripted above is 'writing code' time.

However, I spent more time to try the idea of my thinking.

e.g.: 
1) the suitable data structure to store information
2) the connection and presentation of components
3) etc.
I am not sure if it is fine or not, therefore, I also mention this situation.

Many thanks for such opportunity
